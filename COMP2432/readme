COMP2432 Operating Systems Spring 2024

The subject is presented by Dr. Aquil Mirza Mohammed. The subject covers the topics of importance in the field of operating systems: Linux/Unix environment programming, shell programming, process management, memory management, scheduling, and deadlock avoidance. However, only the concepts but without coding and implementation. And the time-consuming assignments and project of the subject seems to be irrevelant to the operating system design and implementation, but some tricks of dealing with the concepts. Moreover, there are dozens of unnecessary overlaps with COMP1411, COMP2411 and COMP2322 in terms of the concepts. You may get a good grade, but what are really significant in operating systems is still distant from you.

This repository contains my answers to the questions of the COMP1433 assignment. The repository includes one CSV file, three PDF files, and four R files.

CSV file:

employees.csv: This file contains the dataset used in Q2.

PDF files:

Q3(a).pdf: This file contains the theoretical derivation for Q3(a).
Q3(c).pdf: This file contains the answer for Q3(c).
Q3(d) non-coding section.pdf: This file contains the theoretical results for Q3(d).

R files:

q1.R: This file contains the R code for Q1.
q2.R: This file contains the R code for analyzing the data in data.csv for Q2.
q3(b).R: This file contains the R code for simulating the theories in Q3(a).
q3(d) coding section.R: This file contains the R code for simulating the theoretical results in non-coding section of Q3(d).

To run the R files, make sure to have R installed on your computer. You will also need to install ggplot2 package.

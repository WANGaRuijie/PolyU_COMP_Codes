COMP1433 Spring 2023
An introductory math course for data analytics and also an Rlang programming course presented by Dr. Li Jing and Dr. Wu Jibin.
I don't fully agree with the teaching outcome of this course - it focuses too much on concepts and lacks opportunities for practice, which makes it somewhat superficial.

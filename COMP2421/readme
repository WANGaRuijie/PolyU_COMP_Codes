COMP2421 Computer Organization Spring 2024

An excellent subject presented by Dr. Zhou Kai, which is divided into three sections: assembly language and MIPS programming, logic circuits design, and memory hierarchy and computer I/O. Try to fully understand sequential circuits and the use of K-map, excitation tables and finite-state machine, and then there will be no other difficulties. Details in the slides are also of importance for the preparation of the final exam.

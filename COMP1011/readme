COMP1011 Programming Fundamentals Spring 2023

A great basic C++ programming course, presented by Dr. Zheng Yuanqing.

Key points for final exam preparation: 

  basic sorting algorithms (selection, insertion, bubble), 

  linked list manipulation (add, delete, insert, print, special case processing), 

  array manipulation (array initialization and manipulation, cstring manipulation, array and pointers), 

  function calls (call-by-reference, call-by-pointer(single-level or multi-level pointers), call-by-value), 

  and operators (the priority and return values of operators (e.g., i++, ++i, ->, *, &, and .)).
